# Async & Workers

**What silently breaks without workers: publication, scheduling, and live responses.** Publishing or scheduling an activity enqueues Hatchet work; if the Hatchet engine or the general worker isn't running, mutations can fail with `workflow not found` — or scheduled activities simply never go live. Live-quiz answers accepted by the UI are never processed into cockpit/evaluation state without the response processor. When a feature "does nothing" locally, check the workers before debugging the feature.

## Topology

```
student answer → apps/response-api (HTTP) → Hatchet event
                                              ↓
        apps/hatchet-worker-response-processor (consume + re-emit)
                                              ↓
        apps/hatchet-worker-general (aggregation + scheduled jobs)
```

Task definitions are centralized in `packages/hatchet/src/index.ts:prepareHatchetTasks`; the actual handlers are service functions exported from `@klicker-uzh/graphql` as the `HatchetHandlers` map — workers and the GraphQL backend share one business-logic codebase. The backend itself also constructs the tasks at startup and exposes them on the GraphQL context as `ctx.tasks`.

## Response ingest (`apps/response-api`)

Bare `http.createServer`, two routes: `GET /healthz` and `POST /AddResponse`. Non-assessment responses (`handleAddResponse`) emit `response-received:authenticated|anonymous`. The assessment path (`handleAddAssessmentResponse`) verifies a JWT correlation key, dedupes via `hget` on the assessment Redis, then emits `response-received:assessment`; audit-log events (`create-audit-log-entry`) are emitted throughout. Live-quiz vs assessment behavior switches on the `ASSESSMENT_MODE` env var.

## Worker task catalog

`apps/hatchet-worker-response-processor` (`src/index.ts`):

- `processAnonymousResponseTask` — on `response-received:anonymous`
- `processAuthenticatedResponseTask` — durable
- `processAssessmentResponseWorkflow` — durable, with an on-failure audit-log hook
- `aggregateAssessmentResponsesTask` — keyed by `instanceId`

`apps/hatchet-worker-general` (`src/index.ts`) — selects workflows via the `HATCHET_WORKFLOWS` env var (default all; unknown keys are rejected at startup):

- `create-audit-log-entry` (event-driven)
- `publish-scheduled-*` / `end-expired-*` — activity lifecycle
- `aggregate-block-closure-*` — live-quiz block aggregation
- Daily crons (`0 0 * * *`): `updateGroupAverageScores`, `runningRandomGroupAssignments`, `finalRandomGroupAssignments`, `updateWeeklyTimelineEntries`
- `scan-ended-courses` — finds courses ready for final analytics and emits a scoped `course-ended` event

`apps/hatchet-worker-analytics` runs `apps/analytics/src/hatchet_worker.py` directly and is the sole owner of `recompute-learning-analytics` and `recompute-learning-analytics-full`. The native Python workflows execute the 15 analytics modules in-process with bounded cooperative cancellation and fail-fast validity marking. TypeScript retains only the GraphQL/manual event producers and the `scan-ended-courses` task. Several analytics modules use parameterized SQLAlchemy text queries for set-based aggregation; keep values parameterized and treat SQL identifiers and fragments as trusted constants.

## Running locally (config-derived — verify on your machine)

The Hatchet engine runs as the `hatchet` compose service (gRPC 7077, UI 8888); workers need a client token minted by `./util/_create_hatchet_token.sh` (Cypress/CI variant: `_create_hatchet_token_cypress.sh`, which has an HTTP-API fallback for containers without Docker). Workers must see the **same `DATABASE_URL`, `APP_SECRET`, and Redis settings** as the app stack — a worker pointed at the wrong database happily processes events into nowhere. The `packages/graphql` vitest suite also requires a live Hatchet + `HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN` (see [Testing](./testing.md)).

The analytics worker uses the SDK-standard `HATCHET_CLIENT_*` settings, the analytics database connection settings, and optional `ANALYTICS_ALLOW_FULL=1` for guarded full rebuilds. Its SDK health and metrics endpoints are exposed on port 8001 at `/health` and `/metrics`.
