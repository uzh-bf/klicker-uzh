# Async & Workers

**What silently breaks without workers: publication, scheduling, and live responses.** Publishing or scheduling an activity enqueues Hatchet work; if the Hatchet engine or the general worker isn't running, mutations can fail with `workflow not found` — or scheduled activities simply never go live. Live-quiz answers accepted by the UI are never processed into cockpit/evaluation state without the response processor. When a feature "does nothing" locally, check the workers before debugging the feature.

## Topology

```
student answer → apps/response-api (HTTP) → Hatchet event
                                              ↓
        apps/hatchet-worker-response-processor (consume + re-emit)
                                              ↓
        apps/hatchet-worker-general (aggregation + scheduled jobs)
```

Task definitions are centralized in `packages/hatchet/src/index.ts:prepareHatchetTasks`; the actual handlers are service functions exported from `@klicker-uzh/graphql` as the `HatchetHandlers` map — workers and the GraphQL backend share one business-logic codebase. The backend itself also constructs the tasks at startup and exposes them on the GraphQL context as `ctx.tasks`.

CODE questions use a separate receipt-backed path. The participant mutation creates or returns the one active `CodeSubmission`, then enqueues `grade-code-submission` on the general worker. An enqueue error leaves the accepted receipt pending instead of deleting it; `recover-code-submissions` runs every minute to enqueue pending or expired work and closes expired receipts that exhausted three claims. The worker claims the receipt with a token and expiry, calls CodeAPI outside the database transaction, and finalizes the receipt plus the normal response detail, aggregate response, instance statistics, spaced-repetition, points, XP, leaderboard, and timeline writes in one transaction. A duplicate or stale worker cannot finalize after losing its claim. Completion is published through Redis-backed GraphQL pub/sub; participant-owned polling remains the durable fallback if an event is missed.

## Response ingest (`apps/response-api`)

Bare `http.createServer`, two routes: `GET /healthz` and `POST /AddResponse`. Non-assessment responses (`handleAddResponse`) emit `response-received:authenticated|anonymous`. The assessment path (`handleAddAssessmentResponse`) verifies a JWT correlation key, dedupes via `hget` on the assessment Redis, then emits `response-received:assessment`; audit-log events (`create-audit-log-entry`) are emitted throughout. Live-quiz vs assessment behavior switches on the `ASSESSMENT_MODE` env var.

## Worker task catalog

`apps/hatchet-worker-response-processor` (`src/index.ts`):

- `processAnonymousResponseTask` — on `response-received:anonymous`
- `processAuthenticatedResponseTask` — durable
- `processAssessmentResponseWorkflow` — durable, with an on-failure audit-log hook
- `aggregateAssessmentResponsesTask` — keyed by `instanceId`

`apps/hatchet-worker-general` (`src/index.ts`) — selects workflows via the `HATCHET_WORKFLOWS` env var (default all; unknown keys are rejected at startup):

- `grade-code-submission` — claims, executes, and transactionally finalizes one CODE receipt
- `recover-code-submissions` — minutely recovery for pending, expired, and exhausted CODE receipts
- `create-audit-log-entry` (event-driven)
- `publish-scheduled-*` / `end-expired-*` — activity lifecycle
- `aggregate-block-closure-*` — live-quiz block aggregation
- Daily crons (`0 0 * * *`): `updateGroupAverageScores`, `runningRandomGroupAssignments`, `finalRandomGroupAssignments`, `updateWeeklyTimelineEntries`

## Running locally (config-derived — verify on your machine)

The Hatchet engine runs as the `hatchet` compose service (gRPC 7077, UI 8888); workers need a client token minted by `./util/_create_hatchet_token.sh` (Cypress/CI variant: `_create_hatchet_token_cypress.sh`, which has an HTTP-API fallback for containers without Docker). Workers must see the **same `DATABASE_URL`, `APP_SECRET`, and Redis settings** as the app stack — a worker pointed at the wrong database happily processes events into nowhere. The `packages/graphql` vitest suite also requires a live Hatchet + `HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN` (see [Testing](./testing.md)).
