          <strong>Updated on August 1, 2018</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to www.klicker.uzh.ch (the «KLICKERUZH»), a webtool provided
          by the Teaching Center of the Department of Banking and Finance at the
          University of Zurich («UZH»). UZH takes data protection very
          seriously, and as a team of UZH, so do we.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this statement, we explain which user data are collected,
          processed, and disclosed, and for what purpose, and we describe the
          measures taken to safeguard the security of these data. All measures
          conform to the prevailing provisions on data protection. This
          statement refers to KLICKERUZH specific details. For the UZH’s Data
          Protection Statement, which we comply with, please see:{' '}

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          We strive to make our Privacy Policy easy to understand. We also
          encourage you to review the Site Terms of Service, which is the
          agreement between you and KLICKERUZH that governs your use of the
          Site, as well as provides the terms and conditions under which
          KLICKERUZH provides, and you may use, the KLICKERUZH Service (the
          “Service”).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            If you do not agree with the Privacy Policy, or the Terms of
            Service, you may not use this Site, the Service, our applications,
            or our mobile Site.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our consumers as VISITORS and
          USERS. If you visit our Site and do not register (e.g., to participate
          in a poll), we refer to you as a VISITOR. If you choose to register on
          our Site as a lecturer, we refer to you as a USER. Both USERS and
          VISITORS are part of our polling services.
        </p>
        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We collect clickstream information and basic technical information,
            such as browser type, from VISITORS. We also process, but do not
            store, the IP address of VISITORS and USERS for the purpose of our
            polling services.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use cookies to support the polling experience of USERS as well as
            VISITORS. If you participate in a poll as a VISITOR, we generate a
            browser fingerprint that we use to ensure your unique participation
            in the respective poll.
          </li>
          <li>
            The information of VISITORS processed during a KLICKERUZH session is
            the IP address and browser fingerprint only, as VISITORS do not
            register when participating in a poll. This information is only used
            for the purpose of preventing major mis- or abuse during polls.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you register for the Service and become a USER, KLICKERUZH
            collects the same information that is collected from VISITORS, as
            well as the personal information that you submit during the
            registration. Specifically, we process and store the following
            information with relation to USER accounts: email-address, password
            (appropriately hashed), the institution, your user scenario (if
            provided by you), your questions, sessions, and answers to any of
            your polls.
          </li>
          <li>
            KLICKERUZH may use your registration information to contact you to:
            deliver the Service and improve our Site, Service, features and
            content, and provide customer service; administer and enable your
            use, enjoyment and navigation of our Site, Service, and mobile Site;
            better understand your needs and interests; fulfill requests you
            make; and personalize your experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use a limited number of select service providers to perform work
            on our behalf. They are permitted to use personal information only
            for the purpose of providing their services or at an aggregate
            level.
          </li>
          <li>
            The data of USERS and VISITORS are stored on a service provider’s
            server located in Switzerland. The service provider complies with
            the UZH data storage and privacy requirements, and has agreed to the
            UZH’s Data Storage requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order better understand how our USERS and VISITORS navigate the
            KLICKERUZH website we use Google Analytics.
          </li>
          <li>
            We share your personal information only as described in the UZH
            Privacy Policy and do not sell any information.
          </li>
          <li>
            USERS can delete their profile and data (including all questions and
            corresponding responses) completely by using the “Delete Profile”
            button on their account settings page. After use of this button, all
            stored data will be deleted on all servers in use. We are not able
            to restore any accounts deleted through this procedure.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>General Matters</h2>

        <h2>EU and Swiss Data privacy frameworks and GDPR</h2>
        <p>
          KLICKERUZH has self-certified to and complies with the EU and Swiss
          Data privacy frameworks regarding the collection, use and retention of
          personal data. KLICKERUZH also complies with the General Data
          Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”).
        </p>
        <h2>Data and Privacy FAQs</h2>
        <h3>How does KLICKERUZH collect information from Visitors or Users?</h3>
        <p>
          KLICKERUZH may collect non-personal information during your visit to
          the Site or mobile Site through our automatic data collection tools,
          which may include “cookies” and other commonly used technologies. A
          cookie is a small piece of data stored by a user’s browser that
          contains session information to identify you for access and polling
          purposes as you navigate KLICKERUZH. Cookies are required to use our
          service.
        </p>
        <h3>Who can see my polls?</h3>
        <p>
          By default, USERS can only see their own polls and may share the
          results to the audience via their profile. You may share the poll
          results publicly by means of the “Publish Results” button in your
          session settings.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Does KLICKERUZH create user profiles of everyone who visits the Site?
        </h3>
        <p>
          No. KLICKERUZH uses cookies to facilitate the Service’s functionality
          and to preserve USER preferences. When you visit the Site or mobile
          Site, KLICKERUZH may place a cookie in order to improve your
          experience by recognizing you when you visit. But KLICKERUZH does not
          use cookies to create profiles of Visitors or Users.
        </p>
        <p>
          KLICKERUZH also does not use cookies or other information gathering
          tools to automatically collect personal information from VISITORS to
          the Site or mobile Site. We only receive personal information when you
          choose to provide it.
        </p>
        <h3>What other parties can see me on KLICKERUZH?</h3>
        <p>
          As explained above, KLICKERUZH uses a select number of service
          providers to help facilitate our Service. We may employ independent
          companies or other third parties and individuals to help us provide,
          facilitate or improve our Service. They are permitted to use data only
          for the purpose of performing services on our behalf or at an
          aggregate level. Notable third party services you should be aware of
          include web analytics providers like Google Analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some features may expose your presence on the service. For example, if
          you are interacting with a poll from a presenter, they can see your
          responses. If you choose to include any personal information in any of
          your responses, it might be possible to identify you. Otherwise, all
          responses to polls are completely anonymous.
        </p>
        <h3>
          When might KLICKERUZH be required to disclose my personal information?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so
          by law or legal process (such as a court order or a subpoena), (ii) in
          response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we
          believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate (a) to prevent physical
          harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of
          suspected or actual illegal activity, or (b) to protect or defend the
          rights or property of KLICKERUZH, Users, Visitors, or others.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Where your personal information has been requested by any governmental
          entity or other third party pursuant to subpoena or similar legal
          process, we will notify you as quickly as practicable before providing
          any such information, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so
          or we believe in good faith that disclosure is or may be necessary to
          protect life, avoid serious physical injury or property loss or
          damage, or to prevent or investigate an ongoing crime.
        </p>
        <h3>What practices does KLICKERUZH follow to secure my information?</h3>
        <p>
          The security of your personal information is important to us. We
          follow standard industry practices to protect personal information,
          both during transmission and once we receive it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, no method of transmission over the Internet or
          electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
          absolute security. If we discover a security incident that compromises
          your personal information, we will let you know about it, in
          accordance with applicable law.
