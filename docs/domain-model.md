# Domain Model

**The fact most likely to be guessed wrong: gamification runs on two separate tracks.** Points require an _active_ `Participation` in the course and land in `LeaderboardEntry.score`; XP accrues **unconditionally** and lands on `Participant.xp`. Both are computed in `packages/graphql/src/services/stacks.ts:computeAwardedPointsAndXP` — points throttled per instance via `options.resetTimeDays`, XP throttled by the `XP_AWARD_TIMEFRAME_DAYS` constant. A participant who left the leaderboard still earns XP.

Schema sources live in [packages/prisma/src/prisma/schema/](../packages/prisma/src/prisma/schema/) (split by area — see [Data & Migrations](./data-and-migrations.md)).

## Two user populations

|           | `User` (`user.prisma`)    | `Participant` (`participant.prisma`)               |
| --------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Who       | Lecturers/admins          | Students                                           |
| App       | frontend-manage / control | frontend-pwa / chat                                |
| Login     | Edu-ID OIDC, delegated    | username/password, SSO, magic link, LTI, temporary |
| Role enum | `USER` / `ADMIN`          | `PARTICIPANT` / `TEMPORARY_PARTICIPANT`            |

They are unrelated models — never conflate them. A `Participant` joins a `Course` through **`Participation`** (`@@unique([courseId, participantId])`, carries `isActive`) — the domain word is _Participation_, not "Enrollment". Course names like "Testkurs" are seed data only (`packages/prisma-data/src/data/seedTEST.ts`).

`Participation.isActive` is the **course-leaderboard opt-in**, not an enrollment flag. It defaults to `false`; joining the course leaderboard flips it to `true`, and leaving the leaderboard sets it back to `false` while keeping the row and collected points. Participant access to a published chatbot is likewise authorized by the existence of the course `Participation`, regardless of `isActive` (`apps/chat/src/lib/server/apiGuards.ts:requireParticipation`). Assessment course access and assessment report issuance are backed by the **accepted course invitation** plus an active participant account — never by `Participation.isActive` — so leaderboard-inactive students keep their assessment access.

### Assessment participant invitations

`ParticipantInvitation` records the intention to admit one email address to one SSO course before a `Participation` necessarily exists (`packages/prisma/src/prisma/schema/participant.prisma:ParticipantInvitation`). Email and course are unique together; the optional `matriculationNumber` is administrative metadata. Its `InvitationStatus` lifecycle has two states: `PENDING` and `ACCEPTED`. An accepted row links a `Participant` and records `acceptedAt`; it is retained as the admission record.

Invitation creation normalizes emails and matriculation numbers, reports invalid rows without failing the rest of a batch, and immediately accepts an invitation only when exactly one active `Participant` is identified through verified **affiliation** `ParticipantAccount` records (`packages/graphql/src/services/participantInvitations.ts:createParticipantInvitations`). Assessment-course imports accept at most 200 rows per request; larger files must be split before submission. A duplicate email does not create a second row; a newly supplied matriculation number updates only a `PENDING` invitation, while accepted admission records remain immutable. Unexpected database failures surface through GraphQL instead of becoming row-level success data. Lecturer-side deletion is deliberately narrower than course deletion: only `PENDING` invitations can be removed (`packages/graphql/src/services/participantInvitations.ts:deletePendingAssessmentParticipantInvitation`).

## Content hierarchy

- **`Element`** (`element.prisma`) — a question-bank item owned by a `User`; versioned via `version`/`originalId`; `type: ElementType`; options live in a typed `Json` field.
- **`ElementInstance`** — a _placement_ of an Element inside an activity. `type: ElementInstanceType` = `LIVE_QUIZ | PRACTICE_QUIZ | MICROLEARNING | GROUP_ACTIVITY`. It **snapshots** `elementData`/`options` at publication time and accumulates `results` — editing the source Element does not change published instances.
- Grouping differs by activity: **`ElementStack`** (ordered instance group) for PracticeQuiz/MicroLearning/GroupActivity; **`ElementBlock`** (with scheduling status) for LiveQuiz only.

`ElementType`: `SC, MC, KPRIM, FREE_TEXT, NUMERICAL, CONTENT, FLASHCARD, SELECTION, CASE_STUDY`. Type-specific behavior is dispatched in `packages/graphql/src/services/stacks.ts` (correctness: `evaluateChoicesAnswerCorrectness`; per-type grading and response-format branches). Pure scoring math is in `packages/grading/src/index.ts`: `gradeQuestionSC`, `gradeQuestionMC` (hamming-distance partial credit), `gradeQuestionKPRIM` (0 wrong → full, 1 wrong → half, else 0), `gradeQuestionNumerical`.

## Activities

Four activity models in `quiz.prisma`: `LiveQuiz` (formerly "session" — `originalId` and old code names survive), `PracticeQuiz`, `MicroLearning`, `GroupActivity` (plus `GroupActivityInstance`, parameters/clues). The Prisma **view** `UserActivities` unifies all four for listing.

Lifecycle enums:

| Enum                 | Values                                               | Applies to           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `PublicationStatus`  | DRAFT, SCHEDULED, PUBLISHED, ENDED, GRADED, TEMPLATE | all four activities  |
| `ElementStatus`      | DRAFT, REVIEW, READY                                 | Element              |
| `ReviewStatus`       | INCOMPLETE, REVIEWED, MODIFIED_AFTER_REVIEW          | activity review flow |
| `ElementBlockStatus` | SCHEDULED, ACTIVE, EXECUTED                          | LiveQuiz blocks      |
| `AccessMode`         | PUBLIC, RESTRICTED                                   | LiveQuiz             |

Scheduled publication/ending is executed by the Hatchet general worker — without it, SCHEDULED activities never go live (see [Async & Workers](./async-and-workers.md)).

## Course deletion

**Deleting a non-assessment course does not normally delete its live quizzes.**
The required `PracticeQuiz`, `MicroLearning`, and `GroupActivity` relations are
hard-deleted through the course cascade, while `LiveQuiz.courseId` uses
`SetNull`, so linked live quizzes are disconnected and remain in the activity
list. The optional `deleteDraftActivities` argument on
`packages/graphql/src/services/courses.ts:deleteCourse` additionally
hard-deletes linked live quizzes in `PublicationStatus.DRAFT`; live quizzes in
every other status are still disconnected. The lecturer UI keeps this option
off by default and describes it in activity-level terms: the asynchronous
activities already cascade with the course, while opting in additionally
removes linked draft live quizzes
(`apps/frontend-manage/src/components/courses/modals/CourseDeletionModal.tsx:CourseDeletionModal`).

`requestCourseDeletion` accepts the deletion request by setting
`Course.deletionRequestedAt` and handing the requester id and draft-live-quiz
option to the `process-course-deletion` Hatchet event. The marker immediately
excludes the course and all of its activities from user-facing reads; it is not
a user-visible progress state. Retained live quizzes reappear as unassigned
activities once the worker has completed the permanent deletion. Published live
quizzes block acceptance, and the worker clears the marker instead of deleting
if a live quiz was published, the course switched to assessment mode, or the
requester lost ADMIN/OWNER permission in the meantime.

## Course duplication

**Copies share Elements with the source — only the instances are new.** The manage frontend starts duplication through `startCourseDuplication`, which stores a Redis-backed job status, emits the `process-course-duplication` Hatchet event, and returns the job id immediately. The frontend persists that id in `localStorage`, polls `courseDuplicationStatuses`, and shows a success notification with an explicit action to open the copied course when the job reaches `COMPLETED`; it never navigates automatically. Failed, missing, or stale jobs are removed from the active notification UI. The worker still calls `packages/graphql/src/services/courseDuplication.ts:duplicateCourse`, which runs the actual copy in **one interactive transaction** (10 min timeout): afterwards either the full copy exists or nothing does. The legacy `createCourse(sourceCourseId: …)` path still routes directly to `duplicateCourse` for compatibility. Pre-checks that would otherwise produce a partial copy throw a `GraphQLError` with `extensions.code = COURSE_DUPLICATION_PARTIAL_FAILURE`, which the manage frontend maps to a dedicated toast (`apps/frontend-manage/src/components/courses/modals/CourseDuplicationModal.tsx:getCourseDuplicationErrorMessage`).

- **Permission contract (fail-closed):** course-level ADMIN (checked, then re-checked after `recomputeDerivedPermissions`), ADMIN on every selected activity, and ADMIN/OWNER **derived** permission on the Element behind every selected instance (`courseDuplication.ts:assertCourseDuplicationActivityAccess`, `courseDuplication.ts:assertCourseDuplicationInstanceAccess`). Any missing permission aborts the whole duplication.
- **Copied:** selected activities, including live-quiz random selection and ElementStack titles and descriptions (through the existing `manipulate*` services with a transaction client — creation invariants are not re-implemented), direct permissions of the course and of each copied activity (minus the duplicator's own row), `competencyTreeId`, `authType`, gamification/assessment flags. Every copied permission writes an `AuditLogEntry`. If a non-owner ADMIN duplicates, the source owner is granted ADMIN on the copy (`courseDuplication.ts:grantDuplicatedCourseAccessToSourceOwner`); the duplicator becomes OWNER.
- **Not copied:** participants/participations, groups, results, leaderboards, responses. Copies land in DRAFT with zeroed `results`/`anonymousResults` and fresh `instanceStatistics` (`packages/util/src/elements.ts:getActivityInstanceConnectOrCreate`, duplication branch). Live-quiz PINs are regenerated, never reused; a SSO course's `pinCode` is nulled.
- **Shared elements:** duplicated instances connect to the **same `Element` rows** and keep the source instance's `elementData` snapshot (same item version the previous cohort saw, even if the Element moved on — `areInstancesOutdated` flags the drift). Element edits reach both courses only through the instance-update flow.
- **Date shifting:** The duplication dialog requires a new start date; the end date is derived from the original course duration and cannot be edited in the dialog. MicroLearning/GroupActivity schedules shift by the local calendar-day delta between old and new course start while preserving the Europe/Zurich wall-clock time across DST changes (`courseDuplication.ts:getCourseStartDayDelta`, `courseDuplication.ts:applyCourseStartDelta`). The dialog initially derives the group creation deadline from its original offset to the course start, then lets the lecturer override it before creating the copy (`apps/frontend-manage/src/components/courses/modals/CourseDuplicationModal.tsx:FormikNativeDateInput`).

## Gamification details

- Responses are stored as `QuestionResponse`/`QuestionResponseDetail` (`response.prisma`) with `totalPointsAwarded`, `totalXpAwarded`, `score`.
- Leaderboards: `LeaderboardEntry` with `LeaderboardType` `SESSION | COURSE`, updated via `stacks.ts:updateLeaderboardOnQuestionResponse`.
- `Achievement` (`gamification.prisma`) has `type` PARTICIPANT/GROUP/CLASS and `scope` GLOBAL/COURSE, with per-subject instance models; `Level` defines XP thresholds as a linked list; `Title` and `AwardEntry` complete the set.
- **Unmapped (verify in code before relying on it):** the exact trigger points for achievement awards, and the LiveQuiz bonus-point formula (time-decay multipliers).
