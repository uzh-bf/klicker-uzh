# Domain Model

**The fact most likely to be guessed wrong: gamification runs on two separate tracks.** Points require an _active_ `Participation` in the course and land in `LeaderboardEntry.score`; XP accrues **unconditionally** and lands on `Participant.xp`. Both are computed in `packages/graphql/src/services/stacks.ts:computeAwardedPointsAndXP` — points throttled per instance via `options.resetTimeDays`, XP throttled by the `XP_AWARD_TIMEFRAME_DAYS` constant. A participant who left the leaderboard still earns XP.

Schema sources live in [packages/prisma/src/prisma/schema/](../packages/prisma/src/prisma/schema/) (split by area — see [Data & Migrations](./data-and-migrations.md)).

## Two user populations

|           | `User` (`user.prisma`)    | `Participant` (`participant.prisma`)               |
| --------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Who       | Lecturers/admins          | Students                                           |
| App       | frontend-manage / control | frontend-pwa / chat                                |
| Login     | Edu-ID OIDC, delegated    | username/password, SSO, magic link, LTI, temporary |
| Role enum | `USER` / `ADMIN`          | `PARTICIPANT` / `TEMPORARY_PARTICIPANT`            |

They are unrelated models — never conflate them. A `Participant` joins a `Course` through **`Participation`** (`@@unique([courseId, participantId])`, carries `isActive`) — the domain word is _Participation_, not "Enrollment". Course names like "Testkurs" are seed data only (`packages/prisma-data/src/data/seedTEST.ts`).

## Content hierarchy

- **`Element`** (`element.prisma`) — a question-bank item owned by a `User`; versioned via `version`/`originalId`; `type: ElementType`; options live in a typed `Json` field.
- **`ElementInstance`** — a _placement_ of an Element inside an activity. `type: ElementInstanceType` = `LIVE_QUIZ | PRACTICE_QUIZ | MICROLEARNING | GROUP_ACTIVITY`. It **snapshots** `elementData`/`options` at publication time and accumulates `results` — editing the source Element does not change published instances.
- Grouping differs by activity: **`ElementStack`** (ordered instance group) for PracticeQuiz/MicroLearning/GroupActivity; **`ElementBlock`** (with scheduling status) for LiveQuiz only.

`ElementType`: `SC, MC, KPRIM, FREE_TEXT, NUMERICAL, CONTENT, FLASHCARD, SELECTION, CASE_STUDY`. Type-specific behavior is dispatched in `packages/graphql/src/services/stacks.ts` (correctness: `evaluateChoicesAnswerCorrectness`; per-type grading and response-format branches). Pure scoring math is in `packages/grading/src/index.ts`: `gradeQuestionSC`, `gradeQuestionMC` (hamming-distance partial credit), `gradeQuestionKPRIM` (0 wrong → full, 1 wrong → half, else 0), `gradeQuestionNumerical`.

## Activities

Four activity models in `quiz.prisma`: `LiveQuiz` (formerly "session" — `originalId` and old code names survive), `PracticeQuiz`, `MicroLearning`, `GroupActivity` (plus `GroupActivityInstance`, parameters/clues). The Prisma **view** `UserActivities` unifies all four for listing.

Lifecycle enums:

| Enum                 | Values                                               | Applies to           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `PublicationStatus`  | DRAFT, SCHEDULED, PUBLISHED, ENDED, GRADED, TEMPLATE | all four activities  |
| `ElementStatus`      | DRAFT, REVIEW, READY                                 | Element              |
| `ReviewStatus`       | INCOMPLETE, REVIEWED, MODIFIED_AFTER_REVIEW          | activity review flow |
| `ElementBlockStatus` | SCHEDULED, ACTIVE, EXECUTED                          | LiveQuiz blocks      |
| `AccessMode`         | PUBLIC, RESTRICTED                                   | LiveQuiz             |

Scheduled publication/ending is executed by the Hatchet general worker — without it, SCHEDULED activities never go live (see [Async & Workers](./async-and-workers.md)).

## Gamification details

- Responses are stored as `QuestionResponse`/`QuestionResponseDetail` (`response.prisma`) with `totalPointsAwarded`, `totalXpAwarded`, `score`.
- Leaderboards: `LeaderboardEntry` with `LeaderboardType` `SESSION | COURSE`, updated via `stacks.ts:updateLeaderboardOnQuestionResponse`.
- `Achievement` (`gamification.prisma`) has `type` PARTICIPANT/GROUP/CLASS and `scope` GLOBAL/COURSE, with per-subject instance models; `Level` defines XP thresholds as a linked list; `Title` and `AwardEntry` complete the set.
- **Unmapped (verify in code before relying on it):** the exact trigger points for achievement awards, and the LiveQuiz bonus-point formula (time-decay multipliers).

### Live Quiz reward runs and reset

Every newly ended regular Live Quiz owns one active `LiveQuizRewardRun` (`packages/prisma/src/prisma/schema/quiz.prisma:LiveQuizRewardRun`). Reward application, reward-entry creation, and the `ENDED` transition commit in one serializable transaction (`packages/graphql/src/services/liveQuizzes.ts:endRegularLiveQuiz`). Each `LiveQuizRewardEntry` stores the exact course-point, participant-XP, daily-timeline, and achievement-count deltas applied for one participant; nongamified runs have an empty entry list.

Reset transitions the active run from `APPLIED` to `REVERSED` in the same serializable transaction that returns the quiz to `DRAFT` and deletes its execution data (`packages/graphql/src/services/liveQuizReset.ts:executeLiveQuizReset`). Reversed runs remain as accounting records and record the actor and reversal time; a later execution creates a new run. A legacy gamified quiz can reset only when `packages/graphql/src/services/liveQuizRewards.ts:inspectLegacyRegularLiveQuizRewards` can reconstruct its complete reward plan from persisted leaderboards and the unexpired Redis XP hash. Otherwise reset is rejected with `REWARD_DATA_UNAVAILABLE` instead of estimating a rollback.

Timeline reversal targets the original daily entry and schedules an exact recomputation of its historical week (`packages/graphql/src/services/liveQuizRewards.ts:reverseLiveQuizRewardRun`). If daily compaction already removed that row, reset subtracts the ledgered delta from the corresponding weekly entry. If neither row exists, that timeline contribution has already disappeared and no subtraction is made.
