# Domain Model

**The fact most likely to be guessed wrong: gamification runs on two separate tracks.** Points require an _active_ `Participation` in the course and land in `LeaderboardEntry.score`; XP accrues **unconditionally** and lands on `Participant.xp`. Both are computed in `packages/graphql/src/services/stacks.ts:computeAwardedPointsAndXP` — points throttled per instance via `options.resetTimeDays`, XP throttled by the `XP_AWARD_TIMEFRAME_DAYS` constant. A participant who left the leaderboard still earns XP.

Schema sources live in [packages/prisma/src/prisma/schema/](../packages/prisma/src/prisma/schema/) (split by area — see [Data & Migrations](./data-and-migrations.md)).

## Two user populations

|           | `User` (`user.prisma`)    | `Participant` (`participant.prisma`)               |
| --------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Who       | Lecturers/admins          | Students                                           |
| App       | frontend-manage / control | frontend-pwa / chat                                |
| Login     | Edu-ID OIDC, delegated    | username/password, SSO, magic link, LTI, temporary |
| Role enum | `USER` / `ADMIN`          | `PARTICIPANT` / `TEMPORARY_PARTICIPANT`            |

They are unrelated models — never conflate them. A `Participant` joins a `Course` through **`Participation`** (`@@unique([courseId, participantId])`, carries `isActive`) — the domain word is _Participation_, not "Enrollment". Course names like "Testkurs" are seed data only (`packages/prisma-data/src/data/seedTEST.ts`).

`Participation.isActive` is the **course-leaderboard opt-in**, not an enrollment flag. It defaults to `false`; joining the course leaderboard flips it to `true`, and leaving the leaderboard sets it back to `false` while keeping the row and collected points. Assessment course access and assessment report issuance are backed by the **accepted course invitation** plus an active participant account — never by `Participation.isActive` — so leaderboard-inactive students keep their assessment access.

### Private Study streaks

Each active `Participation` also carries a **private Study streak**, visible only to the student (`studyStreakCurrent`, `studyStreakLongest`, `studyStreakFreezeBalance`, plus bookkeeping columns; see ADR 0009). A qualified day means five or more eligible responses (PracticeQuiz or MicroLearning) on one Europe/Zurich weekday within course bounds. Content views do not count. Weekends are neutral: they neither advance nor break the streak and never consume a freeze. The first missed active weekday in a gap may consume one available freeze; a second consecutive missed weekday resets the current streak without consuming another freeze (start balance two, maximum three, earn one after seven further qualified days); an uncovered break resets the current streak. Reconciliation runs fail-open after each response batch commits in a serializable Prisma transaction and groups existing `QuestionResponseDetail` rows by Zurich date, so a streak failure never affects grading or XP. Joining the leaderboard starts tracking; the boot-time rollout and repair migrations initialize already-active leaderboard participations in enabled, non-assessment courses without backfilling earlier responses. The development `Testkurs` seed applies the same timestamp to new and existing active seeded participations. Course overview and participation reads reconcile the private state before returning it. Leaving resets current/progress but preserves longest and balance; rejoining restarts from zero with no backfill.

On the PWA home screen, the fire/current-streak indicator and contextual status are shown only for gamified participations with `isActive`; this presentation reuses the existing read-side fields and adds no streak state.

### Assessment participant invitations

`ParticipantInvitation` records the intention to admit one email address to one SSO course before a `Participation` necessarily exists (`packages/prisma/src/prisma/schema/participant.prisma:ParticipantInvitation`). Email and course are unique together; the optional `matriculationNumber` is administrative metadata. Its `InvitationStatus` lifecycle has two states: `PENDING` and `ACCEPTED`. An accepted row links a `Participant` and records `acceptedAt`; it is retained as the admission record.

Invitation creation normalizes emails and matriculation numbers, reports invalid rows without failing the rest of a batch, and immediately accepts an invitation only when exactly one active `Participant` is identified through verified **affiliation** `ParticipantAccount` records (`packages/graphql/src/services/participantInvitations.ts:createParticipantInvitations`). Assessment-course imports accept at most 200 rows per request; larger files must be split before submission. A duplicate email does not create a second row; a newly supplied matriculation number updates only a `PENDING` invitation, while accepted admission records remain immutable. Unexpected database failures surface through GraphQL instead of becoming row-level success data. Lecturer-side deletion is deliberately narrower than course deletion: only `PENDING` invitations can be removed (`packages/graphql/src/services/participantInvitations.ts:deletePendingAssessmentParticipantInvitation`).

## Content hierarchy

- **`Element`** (`element.prisma`) — a question-bank item owned by a `User`; versioned via `version`/`originalId`; `type: ElementType`; options live in a typed `Json` field.
- **`ElementInstance`** — a _placement_ of an Element inside an activity. `type: ElementInstanceType` = `LIVE_QUIZ | PRACTICE_QUIZ | MICROLEARNING | GROUP_ACTIVITY`. It **snapshots** `elementData`/`options` at publication time and accumulates `results` — editing the source Element does not change published instances.
- Grouping differs by activity: **`ElementStack`** (ordered instance group) for PracticeQuiz/MicroLearning/GroupActivity; **`ElementBlock`** (with scheduling status) for LiveQuiz only.

`ElementType`: `SC, MC, KPRIM, FREE_TEXT, NUMERICAL, CONTENT, FLASHCARD, SELECTION, CASE_STUDY`. Type-specific behavior is dispatched in `packages/graphql/src/services/stacks.ts` (correctness: `evaluateChoicesAnswerCorrectness`; per-type grading and response-format branches). Pure scoring math is in `packages/grading/src/index.ts`: `gradeQuestionSC`, `gradeQuestionMC` (hamming-distance partial credit), `gradeQuestionKPRIM` (0 wrong → full, 1 wrong → half, else 0), `gradeQuestionNumerical`.

## Activities

Four activity models in `quiz.prisma`: `LiveQuiz` (formerly "session" — `originalId` and old code names survive), `PracticeQuiz`, `MicroLearning`, `GroupActivity` (plus `GroupActivityInstance`, parameters/clues). The Prisma **view** `UserActivities` unifies all four for listing.

Lifecycle enums:

| Enum                 | Values                                               | Applies to           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `PublicationStatus`  | DRAFT, SCHEDULED, PUBLISHED, ENDED, GRADED, TEMPLATE | all four activities  |
| `ElementStatus`      | DRAFT, REVIEW, READY                                 | Element              |
| `ReviewStatus`       | INCOMPLETE, REVIEWED, MODIFIED_AFTER_REVIEW          | activity review flow |
| `ElementBlockStatus` | SCHEDULED, ACTIVE, EXECUTED                          | LiveQuiz blocks      |
| `AccessMode`         | PUBLIC, RESTRICTED                                   | LiveQuiz             |

Scheduled publication/ending is executed by the Hatchet general worker — without it, SCHEDULED activities never go live (see [Async & Workers](./async-and-workers.md)).

## Course deletion

**Deleting a non-assessment course does not normally delete its live quizzes.**
The required `PracticeQuiz`, `MicroLearning`, and `GroupActivity` relations are
hard-deleted through the course cascade, while `LiveQuiz.courseId` uses
`SetNull`, so linked live quizzes are disconnected and remain in the activity
list. The optional `deleteDraftActivities` argument on
`packages/graphql/src/services/courses.ts:deleteCourse` additionally
hard-deletes linked live quizzes in `PublicationStatus.DRAFT`; live quizzes in
every other status are still disconnected. The lecturer UI keeps this option
off by default and describes it in activity-level terms: the asynchronous
activities already cascade with the course, while opting in additionally
removes linked draft live quizzes
(`apps/frontend-manage/src/components/courses/modals/CourseDeletionModal.tsx:CourseDeletionModal`).

## Course duplication

**Copies share Elements with the source — only the instances are new.** The manage frontend starts duplication through `startCourseDuplication`, which stores a Redis-backed job status, emits the `process-course-duplication` Hatchet event, and returns the job id immediately. The frontend persists that id in `localStorage`, polls `courseDuplicationStatuses`, and shows a success notification with an explicit action to open the copied course when the job reaches `COMPLETED`; it never navigates automatically. Failed, missing, or stale jobs are removed from the active notification UI. The worker still calls `packages/graphql/src/services/courseDuplication.ts:duplicateCourse`, which runs the actual copy in **one interactive transaction** (10 min timeout): afterwards either the full copy exists or nothing does. The legacy `createCourse(sourceCourseId: …)` path still routes directly to `duplicateCourse` for compatibility. Pre-checks that would otherwise produce a partial copy throw a `GraphQLError` with `extensions.code = COURSE_DUPLICATION_PARTIAL_FAILURE`, which the manage frontend maps to a dedicated toast (`apps/frontend-manage/src/components/courses/modals/CourseDuplicationModal.tsx:getCourseDuplicationErrorMessage`).

- **Permission contract (fail-closed):** course-level ADMIN (checked, then re-checked after `recomputeDerivedPermissions`), ADMIN on every selected activity, and ADMIN/OWNER **derived** permission on the Element behind every selected instance (`courseDuplication.ts:assertCourseDuplicationActivityAccess`, `courseDuplication.ts:assertCourseDuplicationInstanceAccess`). Any missing permission aborts the whole duplication.
- **Copied:** selected activities, including live-quiz random selection and ElementStack titles and descriptions (through the existing `manipulate*` services with a transaction client — creation invariants are not re-implemented), direct permissions of the course and of each copied activity (minus the duplicator's own row), `competencyTreeId`, `authType`, gamification/assessment flags. Every copied permission writes an `AuditLogEntry`. If a non-owner ADMIN duplicates, the source owner is granted ADMIN on the copy (`courseDuplication.ts:grantDuplicatedCourseAccessToSourceOwner`); the duplicator becomes OWNER.
- **Not copied:** participants/participations, groups, results, leaderboards, responses. Copies land in DRAFT with zeroed `results`/`anonymousResults` and fresh `instanceStatistics` (`packages/util/src/elements.ts:getActivityInstanceConnectOrCreate`, duplication branch). Live-quiz PINs are regenerated, never reused; a SSO course's `pinCode` is nulled.
- **Shared elements:** duplicated instances connect to the **same `Element` rows** and keep the source instance's `elementData` snapshot (same item version the previous cohort saw, even if the Element moved on — `areInstancesOutdated` flags the drift). Element edits reach both courses only through the instance-update flow.
- **Date shifting:** MicroLearning/GroupActivity schedules shift by the local calendar-day delta between old and new course start while preserving the Europe/Zurich wall-clock time across DST changes (`courseDuplication.ts:getCourseStartDayDelta`, `courseDuplication.ts:applyCourseStartDelta`). The duplication dialog initially derives the group creation deadline from its original offset to the course start, then lets the lecturer override it before creating the copy (`apps/frontend-manage/src/components/courses/modals/CourseDuplicationModal.tsx:FormikNativeDateInput`).

## Gamification details

- Responses are stored as `QuestionResponse`/`QuestionResponseDetail` (`response.prisma`) with `totalPointsAwarded`, `totalXpAwarded`, `score`.
- Leaderboards: `LeaderboardEntry` with `LeaderboardType` `SESSION | COURSE`, updated via `stacks.ts:updateLeaderboardOnQuestionResponse`.
- `Achievement` (`gamification.prisma`) has `type` PARTICIPANT/GROUP/CLASS and `scope` GLOBAL/COURSE, with per-subject instance models; `Level` defines XP thresholds as a linked list; `Title` and `AwardEntry` complete the set.
  All seeded achievements are marked `isDiscoverable=true`: staff has manually distributed every entry at least once. Coded award paths exist for live quiz podium places (Champion, Vice-Champion, Vice-Vice-Champion in `liveQuizzes.ts`) and group activity awards (Dream Team and Team Spirit in `groups.ts`); the rest are granted manually by staff. If a future achievement ships without an award path or manual distribution, set its seed entry to `isDiscoverable=false`.
- When a student receives a discoverable achievement, the instance starts with `receiptAcknowledgedAt=null`. The receipt-boundary migration backfills that field for existing instances, so only awards created after rollout can appear as new receipts. The student sees a "New achievement unlocked!" badge until the PWA makes a non-blocking call to `acknowledgeAchievementReceipt`, which sets the timestamp idempotently; a failed call leaves the badge visible for a later retry. The receipt field is available only on the authenticated participant's own achievement data and is omitted from public participant profiles.
- **Unmapped (verify in code before relying on it):** the LiveQuiz bonus-point formula (time-decay multipliers).
