## v1.5.1 (September 2020)

The latest release of KlickerUZH has been developed during the spring semester 2020, as well as preceding the fall semester 2020. The following features have been added or improved:

- Creation of authenticated sessions with participant authentication using username/password or SWITCHaai (sponsored by the Faculty of Business, Economics, and Informatics at UZH).
- Display of feedbacks and confusion entries on the evaluation of past sessions
- Live counters for responses on the running session overview
- Fix: Issue with focus loss on question creation (i.e., being unable to add spaces in title or content)
- Miscellaneous small improvements

## v1.4.0 (January 2020)

With its latest release in January 2020, the KlickerUZH has been improved in a few critical areas:

- Rework of question management and session creation
  - It is now possible to create new questions even during session creation
  - Blocks during session creation can be reordered and removed
- Improvements in the editor for SC/MC questions
  - It is easier to reorder answering options in SC/MC questions (no more Drag and Drop)
  - Answering options are automatically saved on loss of focus, which means that the final option will not be lost anymore (if the question is saved without saving that option)
- Initial toast notifications provide more transparency on the success/failure of certain actions
  - If this feature is well-received, we might extend it to encompass further areas of the KlickerUZH
- Many other small usability changes thanks to the valuable feedback of [Prof. Chat Wacharamanotham](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zpac/people/chat.html)
