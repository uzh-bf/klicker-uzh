Questions are used within sessions and answered by the audience. Also the evaluation is linked to the questions. If you don't need a question in your question pool anymore, you may archive it.

To archive a question and see all archived questions follow these steps:

1. Within the question pool, select the checkbox on the left of every question to archive.
2. Check whether the number of checked questions is correct.
3. Click the _Archive Questions_ button to archive the selected questions.
4. Click the _Show Archive_ filter to show all archived questions.
5. Every archived question is labeled with a red "ARCHIVED" label.
6. Check questions in the archive folder and click on the _Unarchive Qestions_ button.
7. Click on _Show Pool_ (or _Question Pool_) to return to your question pool.

All archived questions are no longer visible within the question pool, unless the archive is displayed explicitly.
