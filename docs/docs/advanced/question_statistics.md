On the [Question Pool](basics/question_pool.md) screen, select the questions you would like to compute basic statistics for and click the _Statistics_ button in the action bar on top of the question list. The file that is then offered for download is structured in a `.csv` format (comma-separated values) and can be opened directly in your favorite spreadsheet application. If you choose to first download the file to your machine, you might have to manually append the `.csv` extension to the filename for it to be correctly recognized.
