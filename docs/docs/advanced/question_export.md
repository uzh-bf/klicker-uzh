On the [Question Pool](basics/question_pool.md) screen, select the questions you would like to export and click the _Export_ button in the action bar on top of the question list. The file that can then be downloaded includes all the data necessary to import the latest version of included questions into another KlickerUZH instance or account.

To import the file that has been created on export (e.g., in another account), open the creation menu (plus button) on the [Question Pool](basics/question_pool.md) and select _Import questions_. Adding your desired export file in the import dialog will allow you to view the contents of the questions to be imported (in a shortened fashion), and if desired, will allow you to import them to your own question pool.
