title: Participant Authentication
---

Participant authentication allows to restrict access to your polls. There are two ways to do that.

1. **Password Distribution:** After your upload of a list of arbitrary usernames/pseudonyms, we generate a list of
username-password combinations that you can distribute to your participants.

2. **SwitchAAI:** After your upload of a list of SwitchAAI accounts (exact matches by email), participants will
get access to your KlickerUZH session using their personal SwitchAAI login. Therefore, you will not be able to emulate any of your participants.

Step by step guide for participant authentication.

1. Create a session
