The Klicker UZH is composed of two services: a frontend service that serves a React single-page application with Next.js, as well as a backend service that serves a GraphQL API with Express/Node.js and Apollo Server.

The entire application is backed by a MongoDB database as a main data store. Some performance-critical tasks are outsourced to a Redis cache service for preprocessing and optimizations.
