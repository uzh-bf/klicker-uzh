  <p>You are a lecturer teaching a large class and rarely interact with your students. To enable students to interact with you in a more approachable way (even if they participate online), you start a session in the KlickerUZH and enable the anonymous Q&A channel. Throughout the lecture, students open the Q&A channel on their device and post new questions or add their vote to existing ones. A teaching assistant supports you during the lecture and responds to any incoming questions that are straightforward to respond to, after which students can review the response on their device.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, any questions that are especially important or hard to respond to in writing are pinned to the lecturer cockpit, where you can review them during the lecture and respond orally. After the conclusion of the lecture, you export the questions and answers from the Q&A channel and post them to the LMS, allowing students to review your responses even after the lecture concluded.</p>

## Evaluation

After its release in the fall 2021, KlickerUZH Live Q&A has already been used in several very large first-year lectures at the University of Zurich. To evaluate the viability of the Q&A approach in university teaching, we have created surveys for both lecturers and students, and are currently gathering results. The surveys will remain active until and including spring 2022, and results will be updated periodically. Results shown here are not based on a statistically significant dataset or analysis.

### Usage

In November 2021, lecturers using the KlickerUZH Live Q&A functionality have received over 400 questions, about 150 of which were resolved with a response through the tool. 62 were resolved without a response (e.g., orally or implicitly), and 68 were deleted (e.g., because of their irrelevance). The length of feedback responses ranged from extensive 530 character explanations to single words like "No".

## Conclusion

Based on preliminary results and direct exchange with lecturers, our conclusion as of now is that KlickerUZH Live Q&A is certainly a viable investment in large lectures, at least if a teaching assistant is available to respond in time. Students feel that their comprehension improves when being able and encouraged to pose their questions. In the case of smaller lectures or when teaching without an assistant, handling the live Q&A, much like a live chat, is often an additional burden (though still feasible).
