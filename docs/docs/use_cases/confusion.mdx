  <p>You are a lecturer teaching complicated topics and would like to get feedback on key metrics like the speed and difficulty of your teaching. You start a session in the KlickerUZH and have the students vote using the confusion barometer. During the lecture, you have the lecturer cockpit in your view, which displays the aggregated votes of the last 10 minutes. You can then continuously adapt your teaching to the circumstances. After the conclusion of your lecture, you view the timeline of the key metrics in its entirety, allowing you to pinpoint sections of your lecture that students found especially difficult or quick.</p>
