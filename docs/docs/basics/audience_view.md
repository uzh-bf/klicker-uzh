This page is presented to the audience to answer questions (left side) and give instant feedback (right side) to the speaker. If you have followed the tutorial, you should see your question ready to be answered on the left side of the screen.

**The view of participants will automatically update upon closing the current and/or opening the next question block.**

Moving the sliders for speed and difficulty instantly sends feedback to the speaker. The input box on the bottom enables sending text feedback or questions to the speaker's session cockpit.

To continue with the tutorial, respond to your question on the left side and add some feedback with the options on the right side. You can then return to your _Running Session_ screen, where you will see the feedbacks you have just added. Click on [Evaluation (Results)](evaluation.md) to continue.
