Before preparing a session, all questions that are to be contained need to be created. Every one of these questions has the following attributes:

1. **Question Title:** A short title that summarizes the question for your later recollection.

2. **Question Type:** Determines how a question can be answered by the audience as well as the available charts for evaluation:

   - _Single Choice (SC):_ Only one of the given answers may be selected.
   - _Multiple Choice (MC):_ Multiple of the given answers may be selected.
   - _Free Text (FT):_ The input is unrestricted (text answers).
   - _Numerical (NR):_ A number within a given range may be chosen (or any number, if no range is provided).

3. **Tags:** To group questions and simplify filtering, tags are used. Type in one or multiple tags or start typing and select an existing tag. Confirm by pressing Enter. Every question needs to have at least one tag.

4. **Question:** The question to be answered by the audience.

   4.1 **Audience Preview:** A preview of how the audience sees the question.

   4.2 **Attached Images:** Images can be attached to a question and will be shown to the audience and on the evaluation screen. An additional image title can be added as auxiliary information.

5. **Available Choices (SC / MC only):** The available answers the audience may choose from. Click the plus sign to add a new answer and type in the answer. Then click the red cross or green tick (5.1 or 5.2) to select whether the answer is correct or not. If there is no correct answer just skip this step and save the answer. Delete answers with the button on the left (5.4). In case of Number range Questions you need to choose your **Input Restrictions (Number Range only):** The range the answer needs to be in. Either provide a lower and upper limit, only one of the said limits or no limit at all.

6. **Save** Press the save button on the bottom to save the question and add it to the [Question Pool](question_pool.md) (see next section).

To continue with the tutorial, fill out the form completely and click on "Save". You will then be redirected to the question pool and can continue with [session creation](session_create.md).
