The session list is divided into three sections:

- **Running Session**: Only shows a session if one session is currently running.
- **Planned Sessions**: Shows all sessions that are created but not completed. These sessions can be started at any time (given that no session is currently running).
- **Completed Sessions**: Shows all completed sessions. These sessions cannot be started again, but one can see the evaluation of the questions.
