When you log into your Klicker UZH Account, you directly reach the [Question Pool](question_pool.md). On the top left corner - next to the word "Question Pool" - you find the Menu symbol (1.). Clicking on it, the navigation menu opens. Via this menu you reach the [Session List](session_list.md), i.e. all running, planned and past sessions, and you can directly jump into your currently [Running Session](session_running.md).
