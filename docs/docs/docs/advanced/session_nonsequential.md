title: Nonsequential Session Execution
---

While the main goal of the session concept is the easy organization of questions in a sequence preceding their execution, the KlickerUZH also allows to deviate from this originally planned sequence. More specifically, blocks that have already been executed (past) can be repeated/continued, and blocks that have been planned for the future can be started immediately (possibly skipping intermediate question blocks). To activate a future or past block immediately, select the "Activate block" option within the block settings menu.
