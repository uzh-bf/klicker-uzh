## Import to KlickerUZH

Before starting to import your data to KlickerUZH, make sure you have finished the export successfully and downloaded all data that you want to migrate from your movo.ch account. The corresponding file should end with ".json".

To import all your question sets to the KlickerUZH, just complete the following steps:

1. If you have not done so already, create a new KlickerUZH account using the [registration form](https://app.klicker.uzh.ch/user/registration). If you are a member of a Swiss university, you can also directly sign in using your SwitchAAI login by selecting this option on the [login page](https://app.klicker.uzh.ch/user/login) (your KlickerUZH account will then automatically be created in the background).

2. After you created and activated your account, you may log yourself in and go to the [movo.ch import page](https://app.klicker.uzh.ch/movo). Note that this link will only work, if you are logged in. The site should then look as the one shown in the image.

3. Make sure that the shown e-mail address is the one you used for your KlickerUZH account where you want to migrate your data to. In case you chose SwitchAAI for login, your institutional e-mail address should be displayed here.

4. You are now ready to upload your data export from movo.ch. For this, just click on the highlighted button and select your .json-File. Ensure that the correct file has been selected for upload, its name should be displayed next to the button.

5. Confirm the upload using the corresponding button on the right. A green banner should confirm that your upload was successful. Please only submit your export-file once, as the questions will be imported multiple times into your account otherwise. You will be notified by e-mail once the migration is completed.

Should your upload not be successful, please try to export your data once more and retry the upload. In case of problems with the Export/Import process, please contact the IT support of movo.ch via [e-mail](mailto:support-its@unibas.ch).

Please also check out the [introductory documentation](/introduction/getting_started), to get started with using the KlickerUZH. If something does not work as expected after your import or later on, contact us through the embedded support channels or using our integrated chat-functionality. We will do our best to answer your questions in a timely manner.

After migrating to KlickerUZH we would like to invite all new users to start an exchange about their experiences with the new tool as well as to provide you with the possibility to ask questions about the KlickerUZH on our dedicated [community page](https://community.klicker.uzh.ch/c/movo/6). Furthermore, feel free to start and/or take part in other discussions on [teaching interatcion, gamification and other topics](https://community.klicker.uzh.ch/) on our community platform.
