KlickerUZH is a web application that supports the interaction between lecturers and their audience in various ways. In a KlickerUZH live quiz (e.g., during a lecture), a speaker may pose questions to be answered by participants over their devices. If so desired by the speaker, the audience may ask questions to which the lecturer can leave a response from within the tool (Live Q&A). KlickerUZH further supports asynchronous interactions (i.e., outside of class) like microlearning and and practice quizzes, as well as collaborative activities (e.g., group activity).

The platform is being developed by the Teaching Center of the Department of Banking and Finance at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. The development and planning roadmap are entirely open-source, allowing for further extensibility and collaboration. This documentation is thought to provide both a helpful guide to users of the KlickerUZH, as well as the necessary information for anyone thinking about contributing to the project or deploying it on their own infrastructure.

## User Guide

To learn how to use the KlickerUZH efficiently, we recommend you get familiar with the core concepts and work through the tutorials. These tutorials have been created to guide you through the entire application by means of examples. The KlickerUZH also offers a number of use cases in university teaching that allow lecturers to achieve different goals depending on their needs. To help you decide which use case best suits your purpose, you will find a selection in the Use Cases area of the documentation.

In case of any questions, please have a look if your problem has already been described in the FAQ. For further support, please feel free to connect with us in our [community](https://www.community.klicker.uzh.ch) or through the other channels as described below.

## Deployment

Instead of using the publicly hosted and freely accessible version of the application (the official "KlickerUZH"), it is also possible to host an instance on private infrastructure. This can be useful if an institution prefers to host their questions and results on private infrastructure only (e.g., if the question contents are sensitive, or the votes are confidential). The only thing to keep in mind is that you are required as reinforced by the license that any extensions of self-hosted instances be provided back to the open-source project (as is good open-source spirit).

To deploy a private KlickerUZH instance, we strongly recommend that you first familiarize yourself with the architecture of the application on our GitHub project. Feel free to get in touch if there are any questions or issues regarding deployment.

## Contributing

In the spirit of open source, we welcome any good-spirited contributions to the KlickerUZH (be it from institutions or individuals). It is generally a good idea to first get an orientation about the general direction of the project from the Roadmap. Please feel free to create an issue or discussion on the klicker-uzh project if you are unsure about your idea or the next steps to its implementation.

Additionally, in order to reduce the time spent on reviewing and refactoring code (on our side as well as yours), we put some Contributing Guidelines in place that must be followed for a contribution to be accepted.

## Support & Community

We offer support for the KlickerUZH on various channels:

- Discussions on our [community platform](https://community.klicker.uzh.ch)
- Github Issues on [uzh-bf/klicker-uzh](https://github.com/uzh-bf/klicker-uzh/discussions)
- Feature Requests / Bug Reports on our [feedback platform](https://klicker-uzh.feedbear.com)

Please bear in mind that even though we strive for good response time and general support (i.e., best-effort), we do not have a dedicated support team for the project, as we are funded primarily through project-based funding.
