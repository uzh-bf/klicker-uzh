**KlickerUZH** is a web application that supports the interaction between lecturers and their audience in various ways. In a KlickerUZH live quiz (e.g., during a lecture), a speaker may pose questions to be answered by participants over their devices. If so desired by the speaker, the audience may ask questions to which the lecturer can leave a response from within the tool (**Live Q&A**). KlickerUZH further supports **asynchronous interactions** (i.e., outside of class) like microlearning and practice quizzes, as well as **collaborative activities** (e.g., group activity).

The platform is being developed by the **Teaching Center** of the **Department of Finance** at the **University of Zurich**, Switzerland. The development is entirely **open-source**, allowing for further extensibility and collaboration. This documentation is designed to provide both a helpful guide to teachers using KlickerUZH, as well as the necessary information for anyone thinking about contributing to the project or deploying it on their own infrastructure.

## User Guide

To learn how to use the KlickerUZH efficiently, we recommend you get familiar with the [**core concepts**](/getting_started/core_concepts/) and work through the [**tutorials**](/tutorials/supported_element_types/). These tutorials have been created to guide you through the entire application by means of examples. KlickerUZH also offers a number of **use cases in university teaching** that allow lecturers to achieve different goals depending on their needs. To help you decide which use case best suits your purpose, you will find a selection in the [Use Cases](/use_cases) area of the documentation.

## Official KlickerUZH

The official instance of KlickerUZH (**www.klicker.uzh.ch**) is provided by the Department of Finance of the University of Zurich. The application and its dependencies are hosted on Microsoft Azure and within Europe. Data processing is outlined further in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy_policy).

- Core functionalities (element library, live quiz, course management, gamification) are **freely accessible** for anyone logging in to our public instance. We always reserve the right of restricting usage over a "fair" amount so that usage for other users is not restricted.
- Advanced features require participation in our **Catalyst program** (see [Catalyst](/catalyst) for more information).
- Lecturers at the University of Zurich (UZH) and affiliated institutions (currently USZ) are **automatically part of the program**, if their Edu-ID is linked to their institutional account.

## Deployment

Instead of using the publicly hosted version of the application (the official "KlickerUZH"), it is also possible to **host an instance on private infrastructure**. This can be useful if an institution prefers to host their questions and results on private infrastructure only (e.g., if the question contents are sensitive, or the votes are confidential).

:::warning
**Important:** You are required, as reinforced by the AGPL license, that any extensions of self-hosted instances be provided as open-source as well (as is good open-source spirit).
:::

To deploy a private KlickerUZH instance, we strongly recommend that you first familiarize yourself with the architecture of the application on our GitHub project. Feel free to get in touch in our community if there are any questions or issues regarding deployment.

## Contributing
