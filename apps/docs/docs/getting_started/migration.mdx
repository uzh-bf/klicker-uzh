title: Migration from v2.0
---

This article contains a short description on how to start the migration process from v2.0 to v3.0.

1. Before starting the migration, you need to create an account in the new KlickerUZH v3.0. For this, head to [http://manage.klicker.uzh.ch/login](http://manage.klicker.uzh.ch/login) and use your Edu-ID credentials to log in. If you do not have an Edu-ID account, you can create one [here](https://eduid.ch/web/registration/1/). Creating an Edu-ID account is free of charge and **not** limited to Swiss universities.
2. Once you logged in, you will be asked to make some initial configuration settings. Read the instructions and confirm your settings. You can also change them later in the settings menu.
3. You will now see the question pool overview. From here, you can start the migration process by clicking on the `Migration`-button in the menu bar or use the direct link [https://manage.klicker.uzh.ch/migration](https://manage.klicker.uzh.ch/migration).
4. Follow the instructions on the migration page. You will be asked to enter your old KlickerUZH v2.0 email address. After that, you will have to confirm the migration by clicking on the link in the email you will receive. Should you encounter problems or not have access to your old email address anymore, please contact us through our [community](https://community.klicker.uzh.ch/) or other communication channels.
