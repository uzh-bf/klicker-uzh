title: Live Quiz - Student View
---

Live quizzes are one of the core functionalities of KlickerUZH. In the following, you find an overview of the student view components of live quiz and live Q&A. For more information on how to use these components as a lecturer, check out the tutorials for [live quiz](/tutorials/live_quiz) and [live Q&A](/tutorials/live_qa), respectively.

#### Polls and Live Quizzes

During the lecture, students have the possibility to answer the questions asked by the lecturers on `https://pwa.klicker.uzh.ch/join/{shortname}` or in the KlickerUZH app (or, if available, in OLAT under the "Live Quiz" module). The results are displayed graphically without delay and can thus be presented and commented on by the lecturers after the answering time has expired.

No login is required to answer the questions. With a login students can participate in the challenge of your course and collect points.

#### Live Q&A and Real-time Feedback

If students have a question or would like to give direct feedback on the lecture, the Live Q&A offers the possibility to ask the lecturers or teaching assistants a question directly during the lecture - even if a studens is participating in the lecture remotely. In addition, KlickerUZH also offers the possibility to provide direct feedback to the lecturers on the speed and difficulty of the lecture during the lecture.

Participation is possible at `https://pwa.klicker.uzh.ch/join/{shortname}` (also anonymously) or via the KlickerUZH app. Live Q&A and confusion feedback are only available, if the lecturer activates them.
