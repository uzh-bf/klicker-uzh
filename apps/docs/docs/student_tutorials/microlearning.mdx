Beyond the setting of live quizzes, KlickerUZH also offers a variety of **asynchronous learning activities**. In addition to the introduced [practice quizzes](/student_tutorials/practice_quiz), **microlearnings** are available. This section describes the student view of microlearnings, to create them, check out the [corresponding section](/tutorials/microlearning).

Instead of being available indefinitely after being published, microlearnings are only available for a **limited time** and can only be answered **once**. Whenever a new microlearning is published, students who have enabled this option receive a **push notification** through the KlickerUZH app. **Points** are awarded for answering questions correctly. The points are added to the **total participant score** of the course.

Microlearnings can be used as part of an **e-learning**, as **blended learning** components or to check the **retention** of certain course content. **Evaluation view** and **statistics** provide important information to the lecturer.
