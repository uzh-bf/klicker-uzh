Beyond the setting of live quizzes, KlickerUZH also offers a variety of asynchronous learning activities. In addition to the introduced [practice quizzes](/student_tutorials/practice_quiz), microlearning elements are available. This section describes the student view of microlearning elements, to create them, check out the [corresponding section](/tutorials/microlearning).

Instead of being available indefinitely after being published, microlearning elements are only available for a limited time and can only be answered once. Whenever a new microlearning element is published, students who have enabled this option receive a push notification through the KlickerUZH app. Points are awarded for answering questions correctly. The points are added to the total participant score of the course.

Microlearning elements can be used as part of an e-learning, as blended learning components or to check the retention of certain course content. Evaluation view and statistics provide important information to the lecturer.
