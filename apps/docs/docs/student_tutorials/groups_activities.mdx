title: Groups and Group Activities - Student View
---

While students compete in leaderboards against each other when collecting points from live quizzes, practice quizzes and microlearnings, KlickerUZH also covers efforts to promote collaboration and teamwork. This section describes the student view of groups and group activities. To create them from the lecturer view, check out the [corresponding section](/tutorials/group_activity/).

Through a corresponding tab on the course page, students can either create a new group or join an existing one, using the corresponding PIN. Groups can be formed until a pre-defined deadline, specified by the lecturer. These groups can solve group activities together, which are created by the lecturer and consist of a set of questions, explanation texts and hints, which are distributed across all participants, promoting collaboration. Group activities are only available in a limited time window and can only be solved once. Points are awarded for answering questions correctly. The points are added to the total participant score of the course and the group score on the group leaderboard.
