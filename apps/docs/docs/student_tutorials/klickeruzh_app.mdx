title: KlickerUZH App
---

To access KlickerUZH from anywhere, there's a **KlickerUZH app**. This app allows you to easily manage and access the **learning content** of your courses (using KlickerUZH), as well as add important elements to your **private repetition library** and participate in gamified elements (Challenge). Additionally, you can activate **push notifications** for microlearning in your courses.

## Android

You can download the KlickerUZH app on the Google Play store using this link:

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.uzh.bf.klicker.pwa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.uzh.bf.klicker.pwa)

After installation, you'll find the app on your home screen and can log in as usual. Enable push notifications for your courses by clicking the **bell icon** of the respective course, after which you'll be informed about new microlearning units and other updates.

## iOS

Since the KlickerUZH app isn't yet available on the iOS App Store, follow these instructions to add the app to your home screen:

1. Open this link on your smartphone: [https://pwa.klicker.uzh.ch/login](https://pwa.klicker.uzh.ch/login)
2. Use the **share dialogue** and click on **"Add to Homescreen"** / **"Zum Startbildschirm zuf√ºgen"**.
3. Accept the app installation. Once installed, you'll be redirected to the log-in. You'll also find a new KlickerUZH icon on your home screen.
