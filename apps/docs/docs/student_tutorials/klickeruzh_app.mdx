title: KlickerUZH App
---

In order to be able to access KlickerUZH from anywhere, there is a KlickerUZH app. The app allows you to easily manage and access the learning content of your courses (using KlickerUZH), as well as add important elements to your private repetition library and participate in the gamified elements (Challenge). In addition, you can activate the push notifications for microlearning in your courses.

## Android

You can download the KlickerUZH app on the Google Play store using the following link:

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.uzh.bf.klicker.pwa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.uzh.bf.klicker.pwa)

After installation, you should find the app on your home screen and can log in as usual. You can enable push notifications for your courses by clicking on the bell icon of the respective course, after which you will be informed about, e.g., new microlearning units.

## iOS

Since the KlickerUZH app is not yet available on the iOS App Store, follow these instructions to add the app onto your home screen.

1. Open the following link on your smartphone: [https://pwa.klicker.uzh.ch/login](https://pwa.klicker.uzh.ch/login)
2. Use the share dialogue and click on the button “Add to Homescreen” / “Zum Startbildschirm zufügen”.
3. Accept that the app is being installed. Once the app is installed, you should be redirected to the log-in. You will also find a new KlickerUZH icon on your home screen.
