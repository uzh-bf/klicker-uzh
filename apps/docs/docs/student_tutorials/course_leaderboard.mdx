title: Courses and Leaderboards
---

After a student has created a **KlickerUZH account** and joined a **course** as outlined in the [account section](/student_tutorials/student_accounts), they can access all available course-related resources. To participate in the **leaderboard** and other course **challenges** and collect **points** themselves, students must actively **join a leaderboard** as shown below.

The leaderboard shows the current **ranking** of all participating students in the course. The ranking is based on the **total number of points** collected by the participants. The leaderboard is only visible to students who have joined it. By clicking on other participants, further information like their **level**, **experience points**, and **achievements** can be shown, if they agreed to that information being visible in the scope of the course.

**Lecturers** can specify **challenges**, set **prizes**, and define **custom achievements** for the course. The leaderboard is a great way to **motivate students** to participate in the course and to **reward** them for their efforts. It represents one of the backbones of the **gamification concept** of KlickerUZH.
