## What is Live Q&A?

IMG

Live Quizzes in KlickerUZH can be coupled with a Live Q&A that enables students to ask questions anonymously. Lecturers can answer either in writing or orally. This facilitates the immediate clarification of questions and fosters interaction between lecturer and students in the classroom.
