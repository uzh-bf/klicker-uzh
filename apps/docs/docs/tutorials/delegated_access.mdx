## What is delegated access for?

The login to KlickerUZH v3.0 is only possible using Edu-ID credentials, which are personal and should not be passed on to other persons. The option to create a separate login with username and password from KlickerUZH v2.0 is not available anymore. Instead, it is now possible to create delegated logins for your account, which can be used by others to access your account and perform certain actions. Depending on the access rights, certain actions will be disabled when using it to log in to KlickerUZH.

Delegated access is often useful for teaching assistans of a course, who can then access the course and create learning activities on behalf of the lecturer or control them in synchronous settings. The different available access levels are specified in a separate section below.

## How can I create a delegated access login for my account?

In order to create a delegated access login for your account, open the [user settings](https://manage.klicker.uzh.ch/user/settings) or click on your shortname in the lecturer frontend and select `Settings`. Under the corresponding section (`Delegated Access`), you can now specify a name for the login and the access level as shown in the screenshot below. The name will only be used for your own reference and to distinguish different logins.

Note that the username of the delegated login will be the shortname of your account and the password is auto-generated. You can generate a different password by clicking the corresponding button. In any case, the password will be displayed only once, so make sure to copy it to a safe place before closing the view.

## Access levels for delegated access

Different access levels allow you to restrict the actions, which are possible when using a delegated login. Currently, the only available access setting is _full access_, which allows to perform all actions, which are possible with your owner account, except from the creation of new logins. In the future, more fine-grained access levels will be available.
