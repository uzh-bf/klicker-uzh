## What is an element?

![Element Editor](/img_v3/question.png)

Elements serve as the fundamental building blocks of KlickerUZH. The element library builds the home screen of KlickerUZH, providing a central hub for creating and editing elements. To gain a basic understanding of the role of elements in KlickerUZH, please refer to the Core Concept - Elements and Use case section.

1. There are several different element types:
    - **Questions**: Single Choice (SC), Multiple Choice (MC), Kprim (KP), Free Text (FT), and Numerical Response (NR)
    - **Flashcards** (FC)
    - **Content Elements** (CT)

2. A pedagogical reflection should precede the creation of elements, as different element types may be more appropriate for different learning settings or learning goals. For more pedagogical considerations, refer to use cases or to UZH Teaching Tools: e.g., https://teachingtools.uzh.ch/en/tools/multiple-choice-co-aufgaben-erstellen

1. The element title is visible to participants and should offer an idea about the subject of the element.
2. Elements can be weighted differently using a multiplier. A multiplier awards correct answers with either x1, x2, x3, or x4 points, if the element is applied within a gamified context.
3. A generic explanation can optionally be entered to be displayed to participants after they interact with the element, regardless of their response. Generic explanations can be used for all element types, however they are only displayed immediately after interacting with elements in Microlearning or Practice Quiz learning activities. In live quizzes, generic explanations are not displayed as the intention is for the content to be discussed in class. Only the students' points are transferred to leaderboard, when gamification is enabled.
4. Sample solutions can optionally be provided for question-type elements. Inputting sample solutions is mandatory for automatic grading of choice-based question types. Providing sample solutions for free-text questions is only recommended when specific words or terms are being queried. To account for capitalization or different spellings, multiple sample solution options can be entered.
5. Answer-feedbacks can be entered for choice-based question types (SC/MC/Kprim). The difference between answer-feedbacks and a generic explanation is that with answer-feedbacks, each answer option can receive specific feedback to enhance the learning effect.
6. For Numerical Questions, hints regarding the range of the number can be provided under Options. Additionally, the precision option allows specifying the desired number of decimal places, including whether rounding should be applied.
7. For Flashcards, both sides of the card can be edited, and rich text formatting can be applied.
8. Content Elements allow for the creation of informational content without requiring participant interaction.
9. The preview section demonstrates how the elements will appear to participants. Choice-based questions can be displayed either in a list format or as a grid.

## How can I manage created elements (e.g., edit, search, sort)?

Since elements (i.e., questions, flashcards, and content elements) can be integrated into various learning activities and reused multiple times, understanding how to edit and arrange them is crucial.

1. Elements can be grouped based on tags, and it is possible to search for element titles in the search field.
2. Elements can be listed by creation date or by title (alphabetically, from a -> z or from z -> a).
3. Elements can be edited, duplicated (and subsequently edited), and deleted. However, any edits made to elements will not affect their status in ongoing implementations within various learning activities (unless the corresponding option is explicitly activated in the edit dialog). Deleted elements cannot be restored, but they will persist within existing sessions.
4. To keep the element pool organized, there is the option to archive elements and retrieve them from the archive at a later time.
5. Elements are the basic building blocks of all learning activities. Most elements can be used in any of the activities, but some restrictions apply. For more details about embedding elements into different learning activities, please refer to the tutorial/workflow section Learning Activities.
