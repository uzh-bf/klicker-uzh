## What is an element?

![Element Editor](/img_v3/question.png)

Elements serve as the fundamental building blocks of KlickerUZH. The element library builds the home screen of KlickerUZH, providing a central hub for creating and editing elements. To gain a basic understanding of the role of elements in KlickerUZH, please refer to the Core Concept - Elements and Use case section.

There are several different element types:

- **Questions**: Single Choice (SC), Multiple Choice (MC), Kprim (KP), Free Text (FT), and Numerical Response (NR)
- **Flashcards** (FC)
- **Content Elements** (CT)

:::info
A pedagogical reflection should precede the creation of elements, as different element types may be more appropriate for different learning settings or learning goals. For more pedagogical considerations, refer to use cases or to UZH Teaching Tools: e.g., https://teachingtools.uzh.ch/en/tools/multiple-choice-co-aufgaben-erstellen

When creating elements, consider the following:

- **Element Title**: Is visible to participants and provide an idea about the element's subject.
- **Weighting**: Elements can be weighted using multipliers (x1, x2, x3, or x4) to award points in gamified contexts.
- **Generic Explanation**:
  - Optional for all element types
  - Displayed to participants after interaction, regardless of response
  - Shown immediately in Microlearning or Practice Quiz activities
  - Not displayed in live quizzes (intended for class discussion)
- **Sample Solutions**:
  - Optionally available for question-type elements
  - Mandatory for automatic grading of choice-based or numerical questions
  - Recommended for free-text questions only when querying specific words/terms
  - Multiple options can be entered to account for capitalization or spelling variations
- **Answer Feedbacks**:
  - Optionally available for choice-based question types (SC/MC/Kprim)
  - Allows specific feedback for each answer option, enhancing learning effect
- **Input Restrictions**:
  - Available for numerical and free-text questions (NR and FT)
  - Can restrict the range of numbers that can be entered
  - Can restrict the length of free-text responses
  - Precision option specifies desired decimal places and rounding
- **Preview**:
  - Demonstrates how elements will appear to participants
  - Choice-based questions can be displayed in list or grid format

## How can I manage created elements (e.g., edit, search, sort)?

Elements (questions, flashcards, and content elements) are the building blocks of learning activities in KlickerUZH. They can be reused across various activities, making efficient management crucial. Here's how you can organize and manipulate your elements:

**Organizing Elements**

- **Grouping**: Use tags to categorize elements
- **Searching**: Find elements by title using the search field
- **Sorting**: List elements by creation/modification date or alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A)
- **Archiving**: Keep your element pool tidy by archiving and later retrieving elements

**Manipulating Elements**

- **Edit**: Modify existing elements. Edits to elements do not affect their status in ongoing learning activities unless explicitly activated in the edit dialog.
- **Duplicate**: Create copies of elements for further editing
- **Delete**: Remove unwanted elements (note: this action is irreversible)

:::info
Most elements can be used in any learning activity, with some restrictions. For detailed information on embedding elements into different activities, refer to the following sections. Remember, elements are persistent within existing sessions, even if deleted from your element pool.
