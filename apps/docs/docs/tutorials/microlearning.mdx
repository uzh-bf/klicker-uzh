## What is a Microlearning?

Microlearning offers short learning units with a limited number of questions, published at specific intervals to counteract the forgetting curve. Students can test themselves, refresh their knowledge, and integrate learning into their everyday lives regardless of time and place.

## How can I create a Microlearning?

**Add a description:**

1. Name: The name of the Microlearning session allows the user to distinguish the particular session from others. It is therefore only visible to the users themselves.
2. Display Name: This name will be shown to the participants while the Microlearning session is being performed.
3. Description: A description of the Microlearning session can optionally be added and will be displayed to the participants at the beginning of the session.

**Adjust the settings:**

4. Course: In this field, the Microlearning session has to be assigned to a course. Note that this is different from the Live Quiz, which can be run independently of a course. If you need help creating a course, please review the [tutorial on course management](/tutorials/course_management).
5. Start/End date: Microlearnings are limited in time. These fields determine the starting and ending points at which the participants have access to the session.
6. Multiplier: The multiplier is a factor with which the points are multiplied when a question is answered. A factor above 1 is only used if gamification is activated .

**Choose your questions:**

For this step, existing questions are required. Note that Microlearning and Practice Quizzes support all element types except from free-text questions, as long as a valid sample solution is specified. If you need help with creating questions or content elements / flashcards, please review the [tutorial on element management](/tutorials/element_management/).
When adding questions, you can choose to have one or multiple questions per stack. It makes sense to have several questions per stack if you provide your students with a task / case study that builds up and the questions are connected.

There are multiple options to add a question to a stack:

7. Drag & Drop: The desired question can be added to a specific stack by simply dragging the question onto the plus sign below the desired stack.
8. Arrows: With the help of the arrows, the arrangement of the questions can be put in the desired order.
9. Select: It is also possible to select one or more questions (with the checkboxes next to them) and insert them into the desired stack or stacks by clicking on the yellow boxes that appear on selection. In this way, questions can be grouped and/or stacked for sequential presentation.
10. Ordering: To order individual elements within a certain stack or move entire stacks (mainly for sequentially ordered practice quizzes), please use the provided arrows.

**End of preparation:**

11. With a click on Create your first Microlearning session is prepared!

## How can I publish a Microlearning and make it accessible to participants?

1. After you create a Microlearning session, you can find it under Courses. Then select the course to which you added the session.
2. In the course you have multiple options. You can...
   - ...copy the access link and provide it to your participants.
   - ...copy the access link to integrate the microlearning into your learning management system through LTI.
   - ...edit your session before publishing it.
   - ...extend the duration of your microlearning, while it is still running.
   - ...publish it. Note that the publishing process makes the microlearning available to all participants after the scheduled start date. Until then, the microlearning will have a "Scheduled" state and can be unpublished and edited again. The change from the scheduled state to the "Published" state is performed automatically at the scheduled start date and is irreversible.
   - ...delete your microlearning with certain restrictions.
3. After publishing your session, your participants can see the session in their account by joining the course. In the app, the Microlearning session is displayed to the participants as shown in the screenshots below.
