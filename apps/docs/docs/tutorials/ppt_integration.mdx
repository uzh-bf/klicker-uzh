# Evaluation in PowerPoint

When using KlickerUZH live quizzes, most lecturers want to display the responses received for the posed questions and their evaluation in real-time. While the live quiz evaluation screen offers this functionality, users inside UZH and other universities that have deployed the corresponding Add-In can now directly integrate this live quiz evaluation view into their PowerPoint presentations.

## Why should I integrate the live quiz evaluation into my PowerPoint presentation?

Integrating the evaluation view directly into your PowerPoint presentation allows you to display the responses to the questions and their evaluation in real-time without having to switch between your presentation and your browser, where KlickerUZH is running.

Moreover, you can already embed the evaluation view inside your presentation before you start the live quiz. The view will automatically update as soon as you open or close the corresponding blocks during the execution of the quiz. For your convenience, KlickerUZH offers different embedding screens:

- **Question Evaluation**: For most use cases, we recommend creating separate slides to evaluate the different questions in your live quiz sequentially. By choosing the question-specific evaluation link, all navigational elements will automatically be hidden to focus on the evaluation of the current question.
- **Evaluation View**: If you choose this link during the embedding, the entire KlickerUZH evaluation view will be embedded into your presentation, including navigational elements to switch between the different stacks and elements.
- **Leaderboard**: In gamified live quizzes, you can choose to embed the leaderboard view to show the current ranking of the participants.

## How can I use the PowerPoint Add-In outside of UZH?

The KlickerUZH Evaluation PowerPoint Add-In has been deployed by the central IT department of UZH to be available for all users inside UZH. Since KlickerUZH is developed as an open-source project, other organizations can easily deploy the Add-In themselves by using the manifest file provided in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uzh-bf/klicker-uzh/blob/f5c1554f332f2dafb513346078b581274f93824f/apps/office-addin/manifest-content.xml). A publication in the Microsoft Store is currently not planned.
