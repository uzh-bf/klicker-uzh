A course is a way to combine various learning activities within a lecture (e.g., a course from the course catalogue). KlickerUZHMicrolearning, Practice Quiz, and Group Activites are specific to a course, while Live Quizzes and Live Q&A can also be used independently. The duration of a course is typically aligned with the semester or a predetermined timeframe, ensuring a structured timeline for learning activities. Gamification elements can be incorporated at the course level, creating challenges that enhance student engagement and motivation throughout the whole course. Further information on gamification follows in a minute.

Courses in KlickerUZH allows students to join within the KlickerUZH app and subsequently provides them with an overview of all available learning activities. The course content can be seamlessly linked with an LMS, facilitating a smooth integration of KlickerUZH within existing educational platforms. By incorporating KlickerUZH within an LMS, students can engage with the learning activities directly through the familiar LMS interface. This integration streamlines the learning process and ensures efficient navigation between the course content, KlickerUZH activities, and other educational resources.
