title: Learning Activities
---

There are five different learning activities available in KlickerUZH: Live Quiz, Live Q&A, Microlearning, Practice Quiz, and Group Activity.

## Live Quiz
Live Quizzes in KlickerUZH involve synchronous interaction during lecture time. Multiple sequential question blocks can be activated at different intervals, allowing students to answer them in real-time. The lecturer can view student responses on the dashboard, aggregated and anonymously (e.g. 243 students answered B). The main focus of Live Quizzes is fostering interaction between the lecturer and students during the lecture.

## Live Q&A
Live Quizzes in KlickerUZH can be coupled with a Live Q&A that enables students to ask questions anonymously. Lecturers can answer either in writing or orally. This facilitates the immediate clarification of questions and fosters interaction between lecturer and students in the classroom.

## Microlearning
Microlearning is a asynchronous learning activity corresponding to a short learning unit with a limited number of questions. Microlearning questions can be published for a limited time and at fixed points during the week, such as one day after the lecture. The purpose of microlearning is to counteract the forgetting curve, according to which our ability to retain information rapidly declines after twenty minutes. With targeted questions, students can test themselves, refresh and consolidate their knowledge - regardless of time and place. This direct and simple access motivates students to integrate learning regularly into their everyday lives.

## Practice Quiz
The practice quiz activity allows for asynchronous learning with longer question sets that specifically target modules or topics and that can be embedded within Learning Management Systems (LMS) like OLAT. These learning activities have no restrictions on when or how often they can be completed, making them a valuable resource for students to monitor their learning progress. Furthermore, the questions within each set can be shown in sequence, shuffled, or ordered based on the date of the last response, providing varied experiences for students. When using gamification, the time frame in which points can be collected from responding to the questions can be customized to, e.g., once a week or day.

## Group Activity
Group Activities involve asynchronous learning activities consisting of a set of questions and clues that encourage collaboration and the practical application of theoretical knowledge within a group. Teamwork is encouraged through the distribution of information, where each team member receives specific details required to solve the task. This setup promotes collaboration, information sharing, and effective communication among group members, resulting in enhanced engagement and learning outcomes.
