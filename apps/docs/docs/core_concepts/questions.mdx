Questions are the foundational component of KlickerUZH as they form the base for student interaction. Lecturers implement questions that they want to ask their students live in a lecture or as a repetition later on. Students/Participants can respond to questions using their personal devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops.  There are five question types available: Single Choice (SC), Multiple Choice (MC), Kprim (KPRIM), Free Text (FT), and Numerical Response (NR).

It is recommended to align the choice of question types with specific learning goals. For example, if you want to check whether the students have understood the previously learned knowledge, single-choice or Kprim questions with a clear answer are suitable (Example: What is the definition of the Sharpe ratio?). To activate studentsâ€™ engagement, questions can be asked without a clear answer. This makes students think about the discussed topic  being covered and gets them directly involved (Example: Where will the SMI be at the end of 2025?). For more didactical information please consult the [use cases](a) or [UZH Teaching Tools](a).

Questions can be grouped and/or stacked for sequential presentation. Sample solutions and explanations can be provided for all question types, while answer-specific feedback is currently limited to choice-based questions. Questions can be graded automatically and yield points for successful completion. Customizable weighting (e.g., to separate easy and difficult questions) can be applied through a multiplier (x1, x2, x3, x4) that will impact the amount of points accumulated.
