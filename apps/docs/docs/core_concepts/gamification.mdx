As part of the gamification concept, KlickerUZH includes an optional challenge system in addition to the design of the storyline and visual aspects. Gamification can be utilized either at the course level or by implementing gamification into specific live quizzes.

Gamification at the course level enable participants to earn points for completing learning activities associated with a course. Therefore, students receive points when they participate in live quizzes and solve microlearning questions, practice quizzes and group activities. The points earned are shown on a course leaderboard. Within a course, students can also form groups to check how their peers are doing and take part in collaborative group activities.

Gamified live quizzes enable participants to earn points for answering questions in the quiz based on the correctness and speed of their responses. The points are displayed on a live quiz leaderboard during class. Accumulated points are transferred to the course leaderboard if gamification is enabled for the course.

Lecturers have the freedom to personalize the implementation of gamification elements according to their preferences. They can award achievements to recognize individual participants' accomplishments (e.g. Team spirit for taking part in a group activity) or giving rewards to further incentivize students' engagement and participation.

To ensure easy accessibility and improve participation, it is recommended to prepare a semester-long timeline outlining the gamified learning activities in KlickerUZH and the challenge details (e.g., if there are any awards for winning the challenge). This provides students with a clear understanding of what to expect during the semester, including when and where they can earn points to progress in the competition. If these elements are clear, students could end up frustrated and quit playing.
