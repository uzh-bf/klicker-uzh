To effectively understand and utilize KlickerUZH, it is important to grasp the four key concepts that form the foundation of the application. These concepts are as follows:

1. **Questions**: Questions are the primary building block of the application. All of the activities provided by KlickerUZH utilize questions that are managed in the question pool. Lecturers can pose questions to the participants and participants can respond using their devices to practice content.

2. **Learning Activities**: Lecturers  can choose between five different types      of activities that suit specific educational objectives and adapt to various teaching methods during live lectures (synchronous learning) or outside of the traditional lecture frame (asynchronous learning). The activities are: Live Quiz, Live Q&A, Microlearning, Practice Quiz and Group Activity.

3. **Courses**: Courses help to implement KlickerUZH Learning Activities into a lecture structure, enabling lecturers to manage different activities and challenges effectively throughout a semester or over a certain period of time.

4. **Gamification**: Gamification of a course, if enabled, incorporates elements like points, achievements, and leaderboards within all learning activities to create a playful challenge and enhance motivation and fun in education. Further gamified elements are course-independent and allow participants to create an avatar and gather experience points throughout all their courses.

By understanding these four key concepts - Questions, Learning Activities, Courses, and Gamification - you will gain a solid base for utilizing KlickerUZH effectively.
