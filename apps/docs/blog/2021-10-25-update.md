Dear users of the KlickerUZH,

More than one month has passed since the start of the fall semester at UZH. Our new Q&A functionality (see [v1.6.0](https://klicker-uzh.feedbear.com/updates)) has been well received by lecturers and already proved to be an interesting interaction especially in large lecture settings. We hope to continue work on our [P-8 project](https://www.klicker.uzh.ch/development) with many more interesting interactions and use cases.

To improve the transparency of our future development, we will be managing our roadmap and collecting user feedback on [Feedbear](https://klicker-uzh.feedbear.com). If you are interested in our further development, have feature requests, or would like to report a bug, please have a look at <https://klicker-uzh.feedbear.com>.

Additionally, we are currently collecting data with a survey on interaction in the classroom. If you are a teacher and have not yet participated, we would very much like to invite you to participate [here](https://hi.switchy.io/6IiJ). It should not take you more than 10 minutes and would be a big help in shaping our future development and the planning of our [P-8 project](https://www.klicker.uzh.ch/development).
